# Contributing

This entire repository is simply a discussion repo. So, the main way to contribute is to jump into the issues and start chatting!

## How to write and comment in issues

If you're opening a new issue, it's better to err on the side of more detail than less. For instance, [this is a good issue](https://github.com/probot/friction/issues/29), which specifies what @bkeepers had issues with, what they wanted, and potentially how to fix it. [This one](https://github.com/probot/friction/issues/5) was less good, because just saying something sucks doesn't actively help contribute to the conversation regarding how to fix it. Like all communication: be clear, be honest, and try and be constructive.

In this repo, we encourage you to say "I also have this problem!" This will help us know a bit more about what we can improve, and what is causing friction for people. Unlike on the rest of GitHub, comments are actually more useful as signals for us than reactions!

If you have meta-questions about this repo, feel free to open an issue about them, too.

## Apps

We have one GitHub App enabled on this repo:

- [Stale](https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/): We use Stale to ensure that conversations here remain relevant. This is for us, the maintainers, so that we don't feel like we've got hundreds of issues to deal with; if you still have an issue, please let us know! We don't want to close issues that are painful for you. Stale just helps us have a bit more breathing space by making sure issues don't pile up forever.

If you're concerned about our apps or feel that they are insensitive in some way, please let us know. This repository is the best place to raise your concerns.

## Code of Conduct

Like everywhere else in the Probot ecosystem, please conform to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/probot/probot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
